# Data analysis in a retail store with SQL and Tableau

### Project Overview

The objective of this data analysis project is to provide insights into various aspects of the sales performance of a retail store from 1996Q3 to 1998Q4. Through a comprehensive data analysis, our goal is to discern trends, make well-informed, data-driven decisions, and enhance our comprehension of the company's overall performance.

The project unfolds in three different phases. Firstly, we establish a data warehouse by merging and aggregating data from multiple tables to create a unified and informative dataset. In the second phase, we conduct exploratory data analysis by executing specific queries to achieve predefined objectives and extract valuable insights from the data. Finally, we employ Tableau to create visualizations that effectively convey the findings derived from the data warehouse.

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for analysis derived from the final project in data management course, containing detailed information about each order made by the company

### Tools

-	MYSQL – Building Data Warehouse and Execute Queries  
-	Tableau – Visualizing Data from Data Warehouse

### First Phase – Building Data Warehouse

To acquire a more profound understanding of customer behavior and product-related insights, my initial choice for the first column is order id. I then aggregate diverse facets of revenue and discounts associated with different product types across various orders.

### Second Phase – Exploratory Data Analysis

#### Customers

1. Should discounts be offered to these customers?
2. What is the predominant product type purchased by each customer?
3. Could we be losing key customers due to delayed shipments?
4. Is our dependence on a particular shipper excessively high for each individual customer?
5. Which other customers are significant to our business?

#### Country

1. The top 10 countries have been the highest revenue generators for the past three years
2. Which market holds the greatest potential?

#### Product

1. Are the discounts offered on various product types justified?
